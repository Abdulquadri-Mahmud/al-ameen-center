                  <Text>Alhamdulillahi Rabbil Alameen.We are pleased 
                    to provide this exciting opportunity to parents 
                    whose dreams involve raising Muslim children 
                    who excel in both their Islamic knowledge and 
                    their chosen professions. Drawing from over 25 
                    years of experience, it has been relatively easy to 
                    produce skilled university graduates and young 
                    individuals who can speak Arabic or memorize 
                    the Qur'an. However, combining these 
                    achievements with creating "Alfas" or 
                    "Alfaresses" with sound knowledge of Islam 
                    while still becoming skilled professionals at a 
                    young age has remained a challenge. We at A-Ameen Integrated Education College have taken 
                    on this challenge with courage and we aim to 
                    deliver it, Inshallah.

                      Great question. It is our pleasure to share our 
                      plans with you. One small commitment you need 
                      to make, though, is that your child would not 
                      leave secondary school at 16 but at age 18. Good 
                      or bad idea, we'll discuss that shortly, in-shaa 
                      Allah. We admit pupils aged 9 -10 who have 
                      completed standard primary school (we'll asses 
                      their math and English skills, as this foundation is 
                      crucial).We take them through a four-year 
                      program that containing the "lle Kewu" syllabus 
                      up to thanawiyyah level in a 4-term-per-year 
                      system under a full boarding environment 
                      running a 6-day, 24/7 schedule. Holidays will be 
                      brief, totaling no more than 8 weeks in a calendar year.

                    Thanks, we will get to this shortly. In fact, we 
                    were about to get there before you cut in. After 
                    the initial four years, graduates will spend 18 
                    months(1-5years) in Junior Secondary School, 
                    focusing on Mathematics, Integrated Science, 
                    English, and Business Studies and following that, 
                    they will enter a 2.5-year Senior Secondary 
                    School Program. In total, a child joining us at age 
                    10 would finish at age 18 and then proceed to 
                    university potentially graduating at 23 (in shaa 
                    Allah).

                    Being expensive is not an objective of ours but 
                    good all round quality costs money. The recent 
                    naira devaluation and attendant inflation in the
                    Nigerian economy also raises its own challenges.
