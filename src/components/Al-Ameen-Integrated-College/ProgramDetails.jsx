                At the end of the first 4 years after completing the thanawiyyah program, 1.5 years will be spent on the key JSS subjects of Mathematics, English, Civics, Business Studies and Basic Science & Technology (5 subjects) after which students will proceed into a 2.5 Senior Secondary Education in pursuance of whatever career he or she chooses. A child should thus be graduating from us at about age 17 as a bonafide Alfa or Alfaress moving into the University to study his or her choice course of study with potential to graduate at 22/23. In the long run, we plan to add A level school (1yr). This Aâ€™ level school may enable anyone who is particularly age centric cut back 1 year in the university although for us, we think age 23 is great enough as there are even advantages in maturity.
