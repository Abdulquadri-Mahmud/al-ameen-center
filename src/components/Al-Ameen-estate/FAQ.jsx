                <Text>In its simplest form, I will say “value for life”. An 
                  Arabic proverb says, choose your neighbor 
                  before you build your house. There are so many 
                  things we as Muslims do together which garnish 
                  our lives positively and ensure we and our kids 
                  are able to have a fair life, we find difficult today 
                  even when we can afford them simply because 
                  of the way our neighborhoods are structured. 
                  We find ourselves turning our sitting-rooms, 
                  perhaps better described as our Television-Rooms into our living-rooms. These living rooms 
                  ultimately become the place where the TV 
                  imprisons the average Muslim household since 
                  we don’t even go clubbing like some others. We 
                  hardly find a space where we can share a bottle 
                  of juice with a brother or sister as the case may 
                  be. The health effect of this lifestyle is up for 
                  debate but while that debate is going on, we at 
                  Al-Ameen asked ourselves how we can make a 
                  difference at least for the sake of our kids. It is 
                  these thoughts that led to the product Allah SWT 
                  has blessed us with today.

                <Text>Great question but indeed the answer is not 
                  about just you rather It is about you and the 
                  quality of life you provide for your own self and 
                  your entire household. An environment where 
                  your kids can cycle outside safely, where you can 
                  network excellently with peers, where your aged 
                  mum can take a stroll safely, where you can go
                  to the mosque at the early hours of our solah and 
                  an environment where you can drop your keys 
                  with your neighbor or at the gate in case 
                  Abdullah returns from school while you are 
                  away, an environment where you can return 
                  from the village and send some tubers of yam to 
                  Ummu Abdurrahman living next door if you 
                  chose. All in all, an environment where you will 
                  enjoy your lives as muslims by Allah's mercies.

                  We are quite flexible. We understand the 
                  challenges of the economy so we do not demand

                  into Al-Ameen Estate. We have ready made 
                  apartments and in case you call in at a period 
                  when all available apartments are taken, we 
                  would in shaa Allah deliver within record time. 
                  The most appropriate way to work out a deal

                This is a question that is dear to us at Al-Ameen 
                Estate. It is made alive in the agreements that we

                today to ensure we begin on a great note. Our 
                approach is such that our systems provide our 
                subscribers access that is free of burden to their 
                property which they have paid for, yet protect 
                them from any potential misuse of the group 
                space in a way that ensures collective interest 
                remain protected over time.

                  This area is indeed one of the unique add-ons 
                  that Al-Ameen Estate brings. What better 
                  environment can we situate our parents than 
                  amongst Muslims who will treat them with 
                  respect and afford them community protection 
                  in a location not yet fully artificial (where the 
                  kind of markets they are used to is still within a 
                  short distance off). This is a location where we 
                  can safely delegate a cleaner to clean the house 
                  once in a while, have someone go chat with them 
                  officially or organize hospital visits. Where does 
                  it get better?
